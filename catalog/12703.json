    "title": "Improper Input Validation",
    "description": "The approveAndCallcode function of a smart contract implementation for Block 18 (18T), an tradable Ethereum ERC20 token, allows attackers to steal assets (e.g., transfer the contract's balances into their account) because the callcode (i.e., _spender.call(_extraData)) is not verified, aka the \"evilReflex\" issue. NOTE: a PeckShield disclosure states \"some researchers have independently discussed the mechanism of such vulnerability.\"\n",
