    "id": "CVE-2018-12885",
    "title": "Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)",
    "description": "The randMod() function of the smart contract implementation for MyCryptoChamp, an Ethereum game, generates a random value with publicly readable variables such as the current block information and a private variable, (which can be read with a getStorageAt call). Therefore, attackers can get powerful champs/items and get rewards.\n",
