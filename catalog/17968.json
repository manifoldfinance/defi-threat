    "id": "CVE-2018-17968",
    "title": "Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)",
    "description": "A gambling smart contract implementation for RuletkaIo, an Ethereum gambling game, generates a random value that is predictable by an external contract call. The developer wrote a random() function that uses a block timestamp and block hash from the Ethereum blockchain. This can be predicted by writing the same random function code in an exploit contract to determine the deadSeat value.\n",
